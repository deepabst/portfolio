## Technology Stack

### Next.js

The portfolio is built using Next.js, a React framework that enables server-side rendering and static site generation. Next.js is chosen for its performance benefits, ease of use, and excellent developer experience.

### React

React is the core library used for building the user interface. It allows for the creation of reusable components, making the development process more efficient and the codebase easier to maintain.

### Tailwind CSS

Tailwind CSS is used for styling the website. It provides a utility-first approach to CSS, allowing for rapid and consistent styling without writing custom CSS. This results in a clean and maintainable codebase.

### TypeScript

TypeScript is used to add static typing to the project. It helps catch errors early in the development process and improves the overall quality and maintainability of the code.

### Lucide Icons

Lucide Icons are used for adding scalable vector icons to the website. They provide a wide range of icons that are easy to customize and integrate into the project.

### Vercel

The website is deployed on Vercel, a cloud platform for static sites and serverless functions. Vercel is chosen for its seamless integration with Next.js, ease of deployment, and excellent performance.

### Other Libraries and Tools

- **Framer Motion**: Used for adding animations and transitions to the website, enhancing the user experience.
- **Formik**: Used for building and managing forms, making it easier to handle form state and validation.
- **Yup**: Used for form validation, ensuring that user inputs meet the required criteria.
- **ESLint**: Used for linting the codebase, enforcing coding standards, and catching potential issues early.
- **Prettier**: Used for code formatting, ensuring a consistent code style across the project.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The website is fully responsive, ensuring a great user experience on all devices, from desktops to mobile phones.
- **Project Showcase**: A section dedicated to showcasing my projects, with detailed descriptions, images, and links to the source code on GitHub.
- **Tech Stack**: A section highlighting the technologies I use and my proficiency in them.
- **Contact Form**: A contact form for visitors to get in touch with me directly through the website.
- **Social Media Links**: Links to my GitHub, LinkedIn, and email for easy access to my social profiles and contact information.

## Conclusion

This portfolio website is a comprehensive showcase of my skills, projects, and experience as a Frontend Engineer. It leverages modern web technologies to provide a fast, responsive, and visually appealing user experience. The use of Next.js, React, Tailwind CSS, and other tools ensures a high-quality and maintainable codebase, making it easy to update and expand in the future.
